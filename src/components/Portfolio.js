                    <h2>Design</h2>
                    <p className="has-header">This site was designed and prototyped in Draw.io and Adobe XD. Each element has been styled independent of prebuilt frameworks such as Bootstrap. My intention behind designing the site by hand is to further my studies in abstract concepts like UI/UX principles alongside the concrete skills needed to implement them. Seeking conceptual understanding, I studied popular opinions on card design, form structure, breadcrumbs, loaders, modals, pagination, navigation, and many more modern design elements. Further, I studied color design, typography, design values, calls to action, and the importance of simplicity.</p>
                    <h2>Implementation</h2>
                    <p className="has-header">In the spirit of exposing myself to new challenges, I chose to implement this site using the React.js framework. The sidebar and content area are split into two seperate components. Each portfolio entry within the content section is a React.js component comprised of a header, body, image, footer, and timeline indicator. Each HTML element has been styled using BEM compliant class names. The styling itself is written in SASS and compiled into CSS. Nested components within a portfolio entry are dynamic and styled according to properties supplied to the React.js components.</p>
                    <p>SASS partials, such as _global.scss and _page.scss, are imported. The partials provide global variables referenced by individual component stylesheets. This removes duplicate definitions and allows customization of variables, such as the primary color, to be modified easily and only once.</p>
                    <p>This project has proven invaluable in developing a familiarity with industry popular frameworks and libraries like React.js and SASS.</p>

                    <h2>Design</h2>
                    <p className="has-header">In a team of three, I worked alongside two peers to design a task management web application tailored to the needs of both an individual and a group. The project was split into three domains of responsibility: structure and visual design, functionality and implementation, and database development and connection. I was personally responsible for:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Developing a suitable SQL database design.</li>
                        <li>Building the database and the procedures needed for interacting with it.</li>
                        <li>Providing an interface in C# to easily communicate and interact the with the database.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h2>Implementation</h2>
                    <p className="has-header">The outcome for the project aimed at exposing myself and my peers to web application development within the Microsoft framework. Our completed application offered:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>A user based login system with data storage and data retrieval all backed by a remote SQL database.</li>
                        <li>A user account dashboard with the ability to add, complete, and remove personally created tasks.</li>
                        <li>A group management system allowing group creation, member subscription, and task management (both for the group as a whole and for each individual group member within it.)</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Group owner's may assign tasks to an individual or broadly assign a task to the group. A member may be added via the Add Member button followed by providing a user's unique username. Collaboration was imperative for the success of this project. While collaborating, our roles often bleed into one anothers. I found this to be very important in finalizing a cohesive web application under the time constraints for the project.</p>

                    <h2>Design</h2>
                    <p className="has-header">Built using Windows Presentation Foundation, this project provides a point-of-sale desktop application for a mock restaurant dubbed Cowboy Cafe. In addition, a Razor Pages website is included to demonstrate the benefits of a Model-View-Controller approach to software development.</p>
                    <p>The projects design phase stressed key Object Oriented Programming concepts such as:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Abstraction</li>
                        <li>Encapsulation</li>
                        <li>Inheritance</li>
                        <li>Polymorphism</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h2>Implementation</h2>
                    <p className="has-header">An interface defines "contractual requirements" for each order item while abstract classes for entrees, sides, and drinks provide inheritable base code alongside variables and methods to be overidden. Views, such as the order summary list, use data binding and listen for property changes to update their contents. As each entree, side, and drink implement the order item interface, lists can very easily define a consistent way to display a collection of order item's contents. Further, because property changes are written into an abstract class, the functionality can then simply be inherited. The benefits of inheritance and abstraction became clear while developing this project.</p>
                    <p>Lastly, the Razor Pages website pulls from the same "Model" within the Model-View-Controller architecture. This means any change to the models menu items will propagate on both the point-of-sale program and the website.</p>

                    <PortfolioTimelineEntryHeader Title="Steam Games Shared Library Unlocker" />
                    <p>The popular video game portal <span style={{ color: "#00E99F" }}>Steam</span> has a feature which allows a user to share their library with friends; the caveat being that no game in the shared library can be currently in use. By chance, I discovered that when launching the <span style={{ color: "#00E99F" }}>Steam Client</span>, it performs an outbound request just after logging in. The response of the request dictates whether the shared library will remain unlocked.</p>
                    <p>In lieue of more invasive exploit development methods, I wrote a <span style={{ color: "#00E99F" }}>Powershell</span> script completely detached from the <span style={{ color: "#00E99F" }}>Steam Client</span> process.</p>
                    <p>The script utilizes tricky firewall rules that, when enabled within millisecond margins, do not allow the outbound request to resolve. The default behavior of the unresolved request does not block the shared library thus leaving it unlocked for use by both users. </p>
                    <p>Of course, the script has not been distributed and may be patched at any time. Along the way, I implemented these features:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>A custom command-line interface complete with command aliasing.</li>
                        <li>Commands to enable and disable the firewall.</li>
                        <li>A command to kill the currently running client and a command to start the client with automatic login.</li>
                        <li>A command to increase/decrease the millisecond timing of firewall toggling.</li>
                        <li>A command to save/load firewall timings from a configuration file.</li>
                        <li>A terminal header displaying script variables states.</li>
